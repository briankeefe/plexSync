- **Files**: ~3,000-5,000 total media files
- **Purpose**: Scale testing, autocomplete performance, memory usage validation

## Platform Compatibility Matrix

### Operating Systems
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 8+, Arch Linux
- **macOS**: 12.0+ (Monterey and newer)
- **Windows**: 10+ (limited metadata support)

### Python Versions

- **Recommended**: 3.2.0+ (optimal progress reporting)
- **Bundled**: Static binary option for compatibility

## Individual File Transfer Scenarios

### Single Movie File Transfer
- **Scenario**: Transfer one movie file (1-50GB) from network mount
- **Expected**: Progress tracking, resume capability, integrity verification
- **Recovery**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff on failure

### TV Episode Range Transfer
- **Scenario**: Transfer selected episodes from a TV season
- **Expected**: Sequential transfer with overall progress tracking
- **Recovery**: Skip failed episodes, continue with remaining files

### Large File Handling
- **Scenario**: Transfer files larger than available RAM
- **Expected**: Streaming transfer without memory exhaustion
- **Recovery**: Resume from exact byte position on interruption

### Network Instability
- **Scenario**: Intermittent connection drops during transfer
- **Expected**: Automatic detection and seamless resume
- **Recovery**: No data loss, continue from last verified byte

## Interactive Selection Performance

### Media Library Browsing
- **Target**: < 50ms to display sorted list of 1,000+ items
- **Measurement**: Time from user input to UI update

### Search and Autocomplete
- **Target**: < 100ms for search results with fuzzy matching
- **Scope**: Real-time search across movie/TV show titles
- **Measurement**: Keystroke-to-result latency

### Episode Selection
- **Target**: < 200ms to display all episodes for a TV show
- **Scope**: Shows with 100+ episodes across multiple seasons
- **Measurement**: Selection interface responsiveness

## Security Requirements

### Credential Management
- **SSH Keys**: Stored in OS keyring, never in plaintext logs
- **Passphrases**: Optional, prompted securely when needed
- **Audit Trail**: All file access attempts logged with redaction

### Data Protection
- **Path Redaction**: Sensitive paths sanitized in logs
- **GDPR Compliance**: Automatic log rotation and secure deletion
- **Encryption**: All network transfers encrypted (SSH/TLS)
- **File Permissions**: Preserve original permissions during transfer

## User Experience Metrics

### Discovery Success Rate
- **Target**: ≥ 95% of media files correctly identified and categorized
- **Measurement**: Manual validation against known media libraries

### Selection Accuracy
- **Target**: Zero false positive selections in autocomplete
- **Measurement**: User selection vs intended media item matching

### Transfer Completion Rate
- **Target**: ≥ 99% successful completion for stable network connections
- **Measurement**: Successful transfers vs attempted transfers

### Error Recovery Rate
- **Target**: ≥ 90% automatic recovery from transient failures
- **Measurement**: Automatic recovery success vs manual intervention required

## Acceptance Criteria

For each release, the following must pass:

1. **Automated Test Suite**: 100% pass rate across all library sizes
2. **Integration Tests**: Media discovery across multiple source types
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: No regression > 10% from baseline
4. **Security Scan**: No critical vulnerabilities
