plexsync sync  # Required explicit command

# After Phase 1
plexsync       # Defaults to sync mode
```

**Files Modified**: `src/plexsync/cli.py`  
**Test Coverage**: 7/7 tests passed (100%)  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Production ready

### Technical Highlights
```python
# Visual selection indicators
selection_indicator = "✅" if is_selected else ""
title_style = "dim" if is_selected else "bold"

# Real-time statistics  
stats_text = f"Total: {len(movies)} movies • {SelectionState().format_size(total_size)}"
if selected_count > 0:
    stats_text += f" • {selected_count} selected"
